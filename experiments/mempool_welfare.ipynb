    "Rationale:\n",
    "- Transactions sent to the public mempool are presumably not intended to be manipulative or adversarial\n",
    "- It is therefore safe to assume that when we run blocks of only transactions from the public mempool, there is no sandwhiches\n",
    "- Then, we can compare the prices that the transactions from the public mempool would get if they were alone with the price they actually got\n",
    "- If the difference is large, this might indicate that MEV was extracted (of course, could also just be random)"
